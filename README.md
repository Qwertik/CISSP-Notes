Data Ownership & Custodianship  
    • Data Owner (often upper management)  
	– Individual responsible and accountable for the protection and classification of a specific data set  
	– The data owner typically delegates most day to-day responsibility such as backup to others (data custodians)  
	– When using discretionary access control (DAC), the data owner/creator allows or denies access to users or   
	groups based on an access control list (ACL). SharePoint allows users to control access  
    • Data Custodian (commonly an administrator)  
	– Individual responsible for implementing and maintaining security controls to meet requirements determined 
	by data owner  
    • Data Processors (users)  
	– Individual who accesses the resources within the business  
	– The user is limited by the security controls put in place by the custodian, which were determined by the 
	owner
